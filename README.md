# Train-scheduler

We wil be creating a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Through this app you can retrieve and manipulate  information with Moment.js. We can also provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
